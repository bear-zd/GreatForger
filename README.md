## Overview

First contact with C# as a relaxed project. Going to make a Reforge System with some Cool!!! effect(not in display, but in weapon attribute effect as I am not good at Game Graphics). 

## What It has now

Now it has a system of item and correspondingly weapon,

transplanted UI

from 1.3 examplemod and some help from other modder . 

Sooner I'm going to code some more attribute effect in my free time.

## How to use this

I wanna this mod is an open source mod, before develop has finished, if you want to test this mod or do your modify, don't forget to change the path of **terraria.targets** in **GreatForger.csproj** which usually in the **C:\Users\user\Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\ModSources** if you are steam user.

after the mod has been develop enough , I will release it in github release and steam workshop(Maybe a lot bugsðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢).

## thanks
