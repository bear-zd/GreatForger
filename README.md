# GreatForger
A terraria mod mainly based on the ExampleMod.

## Overview

First contact with C# as a relaxed project. Going to make a Reforge System with some Cool!!! effect(not in display, but in weapon attribute effect as I am not good at Game Graphics). 

## What It has now

Now it has a system of item and correspondingly weapon,

a NPC and a

transplanted UI

from 1.3 examplemod and some help from other modder . 

Sooner I'm going to code some more attribute effect in my free time.
