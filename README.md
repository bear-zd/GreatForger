## Overview

First contact with C# as a relaxed project. Going to make a Reforge System with some Cool!!! effect(not in display, but in weapon attribute effect as I am not good at Game Graphics). 

## What It has now

Now it has a system of item and correspondingly weapon,

transplanted UI

from 1.3 examplemod and some help from other modder . 

Sooner I'm going to code some more attribute effect in my free time.

## How to use this

I wanna this mod is an open source mod, before develop has finished, if you want to test this mod or do your modify, don't forget to change the path of **terraria.targets** in **GreatForger.csproj** which usually in the **C:\Users\user\Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\ModSources** if you are steam user.

after the mod has been develop enough , I will release it in github release and steam workshop(Maybe a lot bugsüò¢üò¢).


## task list
- Some maybe awsome prefix?

  - Penetrate(projectile can penetrate every block for all shoot projectile weapon)
  - Vampire(regain blood will using)
  - Greedy(more money and more damage)
  - Split(projectile will split into many picies)
  - And so on(if you have a good idea about new prefix please provide me by issue )
- NPC frame image bug(he still using the animation of guide)
- Can't be roll by goblin and Can't have dissatisfy prefix for the different type of weapon
- A random better debuff not just decease one attribute
- Some little bugs(the prefix can be forge by goblin but con't by GreatForger.What a sad!)
- For future there are still a lot work to do:

  - A boss and some other enemy
  - How Great Forger generate in the world
